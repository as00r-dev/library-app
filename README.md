# Library App

This project was made for The Odin Project Curriculum. We were supposed to make a library app which could store books.I added additional features to delete book and also update the number of pages read in a book so that user can track the books they want to read, are reading or finished reading. Right now, this works in local storage so i have added a sample of few books so that anyone can test all the features. In future, when i learn how to add database, i would add profile creation functionality.
